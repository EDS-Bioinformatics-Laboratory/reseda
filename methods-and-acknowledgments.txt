== Methods

The paired-end sequences were assembled using PEAR[pear] and aligned to the IMGT gene database[imgt] with BWA (default settings)[bwa]. Variants were called with samtools mpileup and VarScan (the minimum coverage was set to 1 read)[samtools,varscan]. All differences with respect to the IMGT sequences were therefore considered as somatic hypermutations. The CDR3 sequence was determined by translating the sequences to peptide sequences and searching for conserved motifs in the V and J genes. We searched for N-glycosylation sites using the motif N-X-S/T (where X is any amino acid except proline). A list of subclones was obtained by grouping the sequences by their unique V and J name and CDR3-peptide sequence[reseda]. We calculated the sum/average/mode number of mutations and N-glycosylation sites per subclone and the average percentage of mutations in comparison to the sequence length.
