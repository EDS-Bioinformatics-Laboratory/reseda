Maria uploaded the zip file HN00134734.zip
I downloaded and unpacked this and renamed the files:

* RenameFilesMaria4.ipynb generated the bash script rename-files.sh
* rename-files.sh really renames files
* The renamed files were uploaded to the "data" directory (for location see ENV.sh)

According to Maria the samples 80 and 81 do not have to be analyzed
