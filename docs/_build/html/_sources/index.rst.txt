Running the software on one machine
-----------------------------------

Read the following sections for running the software on one machine:

* Requirements
* Prepare input files
* Run standalone

Running the software on multiple machines
-----------------------------------------

RESEDA can run on multiple machines (such as a cloud system) using the ToPoS pilot
job framework (surfsara.nl) and a job monitoring tool. The input and output data
is stored on a webdav server in that case. Read these pages for instructions:

* Requirements
* Settings
* Prepare input files
* Run with ToPoS
